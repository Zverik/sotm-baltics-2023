Welcome to Riga! Yes, that would be a city that hosts our next State of the Map Baltics
conference, inviting everybody from Baltic states and beyond to share their ideas
and experience related to OpenStreetMap. We have two days this time: **8-9 June 2023**.
Two days of talks, workshops and meeting new map people at the University of Latvia!

This SotM is a part of the [Baltic Geospatial Information Technology Conference](https://www.balticgitconf.eu/).
We cannot thank them enough for letting us borrow a room for OSM-related talks.
Which also means, if you get bored of these, you can attend any of the other
tracks to listen to more specialized topics. Also it means we've got a serious
conference and you have to register to attend.

After doing all of the above, it's time to book a flight, choose a hotel
and add some bookmarks to your mobile map. We've got a page just for that:

Finally, here is the schedule for the OSM-related talks. This year we're more tightly working
with the hosting conference, in attempt to mix the attendees and give more choice
of topics. All talks are in the session 2 room.
