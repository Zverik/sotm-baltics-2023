Welcome to Riga! Yes, that would be a city that host our next State of the Map Baltics
conference, inviting everybody from Baltic states and beyond to share their ideas
and experience related to OpenStreetMap. We have two days this time: **18-19 May 2023**.
On Thursday we might have some workshops and mapping parties, while on Friday
we will meet at the National Library of Latvia for a series of mapping-related talks.

This SotM is a part of the [Baltic Geospatial Information Technology Conference](https://www.balticgitconf.eu/).
We cannot thank them enough for letting us borrow a room for OSM-related talks.
Which also means, if you get bored of these, you can attend any of the other
tracks to listen to more specialized topics. Also it means we've got a serious
conference and you have to register to attend (registration will open a bit later).

After doing all of the above, it's time to book a flight, choose a hotel
and add some bookmarks to your mobile map. We've got a page just for that:
