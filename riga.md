Riga! The Europe's Wifi capital!
But of course there is plenty [more to see](https://www.liveriga.com/en/):
amazing historic facades, cobblestone roads, a river half
a kilometer in width with astonishing views. Fish. Anything to
please a traveller, and we haven't even started on a brand new
venue the conference will be in. Do come here. You've got plenty of options.

# Getting Here

State-owned AirBaltic is your airline of choice: Riga (RIX) is the hub for
this relatively low-cost airline. It offers direct flights from most
European and Middle-East capitals, including Berlin, London, Brussels,
Budapest, Tallinn, and Kyiv. Of course you should consult your flight
booking website of choice for a possibility of a cheaper flight!

Others options of getting to Riga include
a [ferry](https://www.tallinksilja.com/en/latvia-riga) from Stockholm,
Lux Express [buses](https://www.luxexpress.eu/en/routes/) from nearby countries,
driving, or hiring a private yacht.
[See details](https://www.liveriga.com/en/10-arrival) on the official
tourist website.

If you live nearby, there is a chance somebody from the OSM community
will be travelling the same direction, and you could share the costs.
Ask around on the [telegram group](https://t.me/OpenStreetMapOrg) or
on other channels.

# The Venue

It's the **National Library of Latvia!** Last time we held a social event there,
but the building is too big to miss other rooms! Sure it looks hideous,
but inside it hosts plenty of interesting stuff. Including books!

[The building](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=56.94143&mlon=24.09598#map=17/56.94143/24.09598)
is impossible to miss: just look for a national library in your mapping app.
Here's a [GeoURI](geo:56.94145,24.09610?z=16)
and an [Organic Maps marker](https://omaps.app/44wGujuGCS/Latvijas_Nacion%C4%81l%C4%81_bibliot%C4%93ka) for you.
When near, find the Baltic GIT conference banners and follow them.

To get to the library, take:

* a tram: it's right opposite the "Nacionālā bibliotēka" stop, trams 1, 2, 5, 10.
* a bus: same stop for buses 3, 4, 7, 8, 21, 22, 25, 32,
    or a closer one — "LU Akadēmiskais centrs" for bus 23 from the bus and train stations.
* a taxi: [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en/cities/riga/) and [Yandex.Taxi](https://taxi.yandex.lv/)
    are available, no Uber.

# Accomodation

For some reason, it is often cheaper to rent an apartment than a hotel room.
On the [booking.com](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?ac_click_type=b&checkout_year=2023&is_ski_area=&checkout_month=5&place_id_lon=24.105742&no_rooms=1&ss_raw=riga&search_selected=true&iata=RIX&checkin_monthday=18&ac_position=0&checkout_monthday=19&checkin_year=2023&checkin_month=5&efdco=1&src_elem=sb&src=index&place_id_lat=56.949493&ac_suggestion_theme_list_length=0&sb_lp=1&group_children=0&sb=1&auth_success=1&from_sf=1&dest_type=city&ac_langcode=en&dest_id=-3212216&ac_suggestion_list_length=5&group_adults=2&b_h4u_keep_filters=&ss=R%C4%ABga%2C+Vidzeme%2C+Latvia)
website, you'll see plenty of options starting from 30 € a night
(though 50 is a more common price). The best area to rent is of course around the National
Library.

Due to Riga being a popular destination for students and backpackers, there
are many cheap [hostels](https://www.hostelworld.com/search?search_keywords=Riga,%20Latvia&country=Latvia&city=Riga&date_from=2023-05-18&date_to=2023-05-19&number_of_guests=1&display=map),
with prices around 10 € a night. Most of these are located in the city
centre: the best location criteria for you should be a distance to the
nearest tram stop, or to the railway station.

Alas we cannot recommend any specific accomodations, since we haven't used them
much. Please rely on website ratings. If possible, google the name of the chosen
hotel or hostel and book directly: that helps them save on huge booking.com fees.

# Good to Know

* Browse the official [tourist website](https://www.liveriga.com/en/) for info on events and places.
* For public transport, purchase an e-ticket at any street kiosk. A ride costs 1.15 €,
    but 2 € when paid to a driver. Try the [Trafi](https://www.trafi.com/site/en) app.
* Use trams. At least once. Better if you cross the Daugava river.
* Be prepared to find tons of cat-related souvenirs. Cat on a roof is a common symbol of the city.
* There are many free wi-fi access points. When lost or in doubt, contact the organizers:
    Rihards (EN, LV by org email) or Ilya (EN, RU, EE by org email or [telegram](https://t.me/ilyazver)).
  * Org email is [org@sotm-baltics.org](mailto:org@sotm-baltics.org).
